   Exercise 1: Fibonacci3

   A) We are going to define a Fibonacci3 sequence, a variation of the Fibonacci sequence
   (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
   Each number in the Fibonacci3 sequence is a sum of three preceding ones.
   The sequence of Fib3 is "1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, ... ".
   Given n, calculate the n'th number in the Fibonacci3 sequence.

   For any input n s.t. 0 <= n <= 20, your program should terminate within 1 seconds.
